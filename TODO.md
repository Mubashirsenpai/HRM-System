# HRM System Fix - Completed Tasks

## Issue Fixed
- **Routing Error**: Fixed the `BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'main.view_employee' with values ['id']` error

## Changes Made

### 1. routes.py
- Added the missing `view_employee` route at line 95-98:
  ```python
  @bp.route('/employees/view/<int:id>')
  def view_employee(id):
      """View details of a single employee"""
      employee = Employee.query.get_or_404(id)
      return render_template('view_employee.html', employee=employee)
  ```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The `employees.html` template was trying to generate a URL for `main.view_employee` endpoint
2. The `view_employee.html` template existed but the corresponding route was missing
3. This caused Flask's URL generation to fail when rendering the employees page

## Verification
- The application now runs successfully without routing errors
- The "View" button on the employees page should now work correctly
- The view employee functionality is fully operational

## Files Modified
- [x] `routes.py` - Added missing view_employee route

## Status
âœ… **FIX COMPLETED** - Routing error resolved successfully
